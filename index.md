# Overview


LLMs have opened new possibilities of automated agents that plan and complete tasks on the user’s behalf.  Such agents have the potential to usher in a new industrial revolution by automating organizational processes.   However, agents are currently limited to soft-edge tasks that have large tolerances for error, and are too unreliable for hard-edge tasks, like in healthcare or enterprises, where accuracy and reliability are paramount.  In short, what does it take for agents to be used in enterprises?

This graduate-level course will cut across the technology stack to examine the research questions that need to be answered for agents to be possible in real tasks that matter.    Each session will review 1-3 papers or systems, and discuss research opportunities that arise from the gap between existing research and enterprise requirements.  Topics will span systems (data systems and ML systems), AI (LLMs, agent-based planning), HCI, and theory (reinforcement learning, markets).   

Broad questions include

* What mechanisms are data systems missing to support agents?
* How does human-computer interaction change when the human interacts with agents?
* How can knowledge throughout an organization be used to constrain and improve agentic planning?
* How can systems handle the 10-100x increase in load generated by agents?
* What are the theoretical limits of what agents can do?
* At scale, how will the use of agents affect markets, incentives, and the structure of organizations?



### Class Structure

* There will be assigned readings for each week
* Classes will be a mix of discussion about the papers, speculating about new problems, and external speakers
* Due to the speculative nature of the course, students are expected to co-investigate the problems alongside the instructors.

He formerly conducted research at Princeton University advised Prof. Karthik Narasimhan. John works on evaluations, data, and systems around Language Model (LM) agents for software engineering" %}

  * [SWE-agent: Agent-Computer Interfaces Enable Automated Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793)
* Questions
  * What might the future of evaluations for Language Models and AI Systems look like? Can you think of any real world workflows or pipelines (not necessarily within Software Engineering or Tech) that might be interesting testbeds?
  * How might AI agents be deployed in a real world? How might the responsibilities of a software developer / manager and the technology market itself evolve in response to AI co-pilots?


<span class="date">02/04</span> <span class="topic">Programming Foundation Models</span> [Thomas Joshi](), Columbia {% include toggle.html content="Thomas Joshi is co-author of Stanford DSPy and leads the GenAI Collective, the largest AI community in the US with over 30,000 members across chapters in SF, NYC, Boston, London, Paris, and other cities. DSPy has been used by Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, NASDAQ, Carlyle, ABN Amro, JetBlue, Cohere, and others. Thomas is passionate about modular approaches to AI system design, enabling engineers to optimize LLM pipelines for performance and cost-efficiency." %}

* Readings
  * [DSPy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03714)
* Questions
  * Modular frameworks like DSPy enhance flexibility and scalability in agentic systems but may introduce inefficiencies due to communication overhead between modules. How do these trade-offs affect the performance of agents in real-world applications? What strategies could be used to minimize these inefficiencies while retaining the advantages of modularity?
  * DSPy’s modular agents use predefined components tailored to specific tasks, but dynamic environments often demand adaptability. How can agents built with modular frameworks autonomously adapt or reconfigure their modules to address unforeseen challenges? What are the current limitations of modular designs in this context, and how could future advancements improve their adaptability?
