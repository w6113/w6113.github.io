### <a name="showcase"/>Project Showcase 

Your team will prepare and present a project poster at the end-of-course showcase session.   This gives you an opportunity to present a short presentation demo of your work and show what you have accomplished in the class!  

Your presentation should be polished.  Since there is still time until the final report, you are encouraged to also discuss ideas or challenges you are still considering.  

**Since you are presenting to your peers as well, make sure you give your colleagues enough context to understand your ideas.  In addition to _what_ you did, help your colleagues understand _why_ you made your specific choices, and provide examples.  It's better to make sure the audience learns a few specific ideas than try to say everything.**  Come to office hours or contact the staff if you would like feedback.

Overall logistics

* team will be given 15 minutes : 10 min presentation, 5 min q&a and feedbacks
* Timing is strict since we have many groups.  *Practice ahead of time so your presentation is smooth!  Only takes 10 minutes per practice :)*
* Each team member should speak
* Make sure all demos are embedded as GIFs or videos in your slides.
* Staff will host and share their screen; we will change slides on your behalf

Your presentation should cover (in content, not necessarily one slide for each point)

* GIF/video of demos/screenshots (if applicable)

**Submission**

* Add your slides to [this google slides link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DxOwDimvIqsGucENR6Qa2VCZ617u1REhaHn3lOJZ6Mo/edit?usp=sharing)
* Deadline for submission: Wednesday Apr 26, 11:59PM EST

### Report/Camera Ready

You will revise your draft and submit a conference-style report on your project, with **maximum length** of 10 pages. 
Because this report is the primary deliverable upon which you will be graded, **do not treat it as an afterthought**. Plan to leave at least a week to do the writing, and make sure your proofread and edit carefully!
